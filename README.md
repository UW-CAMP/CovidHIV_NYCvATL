We provide this code so that interested readers may understand our analytical methods in more detail. It does not provide stand-alone reproducibility, however, since we do not include the data here. This study uses data provided by four outside sources to conduct secondary analyses. Our data use agreements preclude us from sharing these data in order to maximize the sources’ ability to ensure patient/respondent confidentiality and safety. Each source has its own process for additional qualified users to obtain data after a process of scientific review to balance safety concerns with research needs. Links to these processes are:
